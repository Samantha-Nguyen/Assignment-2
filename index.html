    On the heels of Enigma, the code Turing is credited with cracking, the German army asked the Lorenz Company to create the more complex Lorenz teleprinter cipher, which earned the codename “Tunny” by the British. By the time the war ended, ten Colossus machines had been built to wage a relentless battle against Tunny. The credit belongs to Flowers and his team of engineers.
